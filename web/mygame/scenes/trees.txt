A light fog is beginning to encircle the estate. It’s tendrils reach from deep in the forest and dance around the outlying trees, like maggots working their way through a sinewy muscle. Jane scans the downstairs for The Mother or The Child, but finds neither. The musty grandfather clock on near the front door reads Seven AM. Outside, the sun does it's best to break through the gloom and illuminate a few patches of hard ground, and for a moment the house is lit with the subdued glow of snow-refracted sunlight. This momentary brightness leaking through a vaulted window lights Jane as she wraps herself in her sweater and throws on her coat. She flips her hair out of her eyes and makes her way to the front door.

Jane reaches for the deadbolt to unlock it and finds that it is open. Her nerves spike at this revelation: someone has been in, or out, of the house. Perhaps the mother has gone out to fetch something from the car, but in this weather it would be unwise to bring The Child along with her. And then, of course, the car is not there anyways. 'We got a ride with that cop' she remembers.

The light diminishes again, and an ominous air begins to descend upon the morning. Brown and grey. Where is the mother? Where is the child? Jane feels an almost dreamlike uncertainty wash over her.

	#Determined to assess the situation, Jane yanks the door open wide and rushes out into the front yard.

		Jane opens the door and runs outside, but something is different out here. Where there was once a derelict stone pathway from the parking area are now the budding trunks of three young Elms forming a loose canopy over the walkway. Their leaves are bright green against the grey,  and the wind stirs their juvenile branches eerily overhead.

	#Jane's suspicions rise. It is unlike the Mother to take the child without leaving a note, and even less like her to leave the door unlocked. Jane spies through the peephole.

		Pressing her forehead against the front door and centering her left eye, Jane scans the front yard for a moment before a convulsive shiver overtakes her. Inexplicably, there are three young Elms lining the path to the front door which were not there yesterday. Their leaves, although barely budding in the cold and dreary day, are a bright green only intensified by their uncanny placement in an otherwise drab view.

		Is this what the Mother is doing? Planting trees at Seven in the morning? And if so, where is she?

			#Jane spends a few moments investigating the new trees.
				Jane knows very little of trees. Although she could potentially spot a Maple by it's leaf, or identify an Aspen by it’s changing color, she is ill-equipped to determine much about the trees aside from their obvious newness. She places her hand against one to feel it's bark but draws it back sharply. The tree is hot to the touch. If the mother did plant these here, she must have done so just moments ago.

				But there is no fresh earth surrounding the trunks. Impossibly, it is as if the trees simply grew overnight.

			#Jane runs around the side of the house. Perhaps the Mother is in the toolshed.
				Ignoring her mother's curious landscaping choices for the time being, Jane runs left around the house towards the old toolshed. Jane has always been told not to explore in there as the Mother believes it too dangerous. The squat, sun bleached building sits gathering a sheet of fresh snow. As she approaches, a wind rises and causes the shed to slough off a thin blanket of the snow. It's dilapidated facade speaks of the true age of the house. Banging on the double doors, she sees that the usual metal padlock is engaged through it's rings.
