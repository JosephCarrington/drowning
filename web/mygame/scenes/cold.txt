Jane and The Child are shivering together. They lay under every blanket she can find in the trailer. The Mother and Christian are off at a get-together, but the heat has run out and The Family is elsewhere. Here in the desert, they were not expecting this kind of cold. But the sun has set and taken all it's heat with it. Jane lays snuggling The Child and watching the Yucca and tumbleweeds blow about in the early frost. She feels The Child's warmth and hopes she gives back to him more than she takes. She is larger than he, and she feels her body is capable of a heat his young form can not even begin to understand. Her legs quietly yearn. She holds The Child closer.

Later The Mother and Christian get back. They are drunk and after a few attempted secrecies, resign to the bedroom for the ritual required for their moribund sexuality. Jane hears them knocking things over as she wills herself to sleep.

and Jane looks around, and finds the earth has gone quiet. She is once again at the top of the hill, enclosed by the small copse of trees. The Child whimpers softly, half asleep, his hot breath warming her armpit. They are both freezing.

Jane raises, half-expecting the ground to shiver under her feet. Finding it solid, she cranes her neck looking for some remembered point to situate herself and sees the house. She steadies and begins a rejuvenated march back to their home. She finds a straight line to it, and it is as if the trees bend around her as she slogs on, snow collecting on the faux-fir trim of her hood. The trees are aligning themselves into straight lines, each of them caressing her with their branches as she stumbles bleary-eyed. A matrix of the same trees over and over spreads off into infinity, but the house remains. The last few feet are achingly slow. She feels the snow beneath her feet, then beneath her knees, then beneath her arms, but: a last gasp, she runs toward the home, her arms around The Child.

The sky goes all white.

The front door yawns.
